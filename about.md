# Hello. I'm Abe Land.

## What I do

### Coding

I'm a software engineer by trade and computer scientist by training.

I went to Stanford and got a couple Computer Science degrees there. It was a great time where I learned a lot and met my best friends and my wife.

I worked at Facebook for a long time (to me, anyways): I interned during the summer of 2010 during which I [built the send button](https://www.facebook.com/notes/facebook-engineering/building-the-send-button/10150165494748920/) and helped with the Facebook comments plugin.

Then I joined Facebook full-time and I built a ton of stuff, most of which I can't talk about. But, among other things, I worked on fighting spam and building infrastructure to that end, some security infrastructure, notifications, and finished my time at Facebook by working on the [partnership](https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2015/09/introducing-facebook-and-summits-k-12-education-project/) they had with Summit Public Schools (it's [now part of the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative](https://www.facebook.com/summitpersonalizedlearning/posts/1874297772785076)).

### Climbing

I really like climbing. I mostly climb indoors but [sometimes I go out and get humbled on real rock](https://www.mountainproject.com/u/abe-land//112504014?action=ticks&). I mostly enjoy sport climbing but most of my friends boulder so I do that too even though I find it super boring.

### Coffee

Coffee is great. Aside from helping you wake up and get focused, it [helps you poop](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/speaking-of-science/wp/2015/08/10/why-does-coffee-make-you-poop/), [might prevent Alzheimer's/dementia](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20182054), and has [a bunch of other benefits](http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/expert-answers/coffee-and-health/faq-20058339). Also it tastes amazing. A good cup of coffee needs no cream or sugar.

## What I believe

I'm a Christian. To me, the gospel is the most compelling story of how we got here and why we are here. Similarly, the person of Jesus is irresistable to me, embodying God's goodness, grace, mercy, justice, and peace. I am especially drawn to the 'red letters' -- the parts of the Bible which are Jesus' own words recorded by those who heard him personally. When I read these words, I am convinced in my soul that Jesus is God and he is calling us to him. A couple of authors who I generally agree with are [C.S. Lewis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._S._Lewis) and [Tim Keller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Keller_(pastor)).
