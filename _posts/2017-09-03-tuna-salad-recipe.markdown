How to make Tuna Salad. Pretty basic but it's fast and delicious AF:

### Ingredients

1. 4 cans of albacore tuna in water, no salt added (control your own seasoning)
2. 2 tablespoons of real mayo (if you like mayo a lot, you can up this to 3)
3. 2 teaspoons dijon mustard (or whatever mustard you like)
4. 1 teaspoon capers
5. 1-2 tablespoon sweet pickle relish, depending on how sweet you like your tuna salad
6. the juice from half a lemon
7. salt and pepper to taste

### Instructions

Mix the ingredients together in a bowl. Optionally put this in a sandwich with cheese to make a tuna melt. You're welcome.
